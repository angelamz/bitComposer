CSCB58 Project File: Winter 2018

Project Title: Bit Music Composer

Project Description:
Create a system that plays an editable tune. It allows you to change what notes are played as
the sound loops. There will be four speakers that each plays a different note in a pattern. Using
the keys on the DE2 board to access a corresponding speaker, you can change the pattern of
notes using the switches. Each switch will correspond to one beat, resulting in a loop of 18
beats for the 18 switches.

Proposal
--------
What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
Be able to play notes on multiple speakers based on input from the DE2 board. Start creating a
continuous loop.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
Finish generating a continuous loop of notes. Get one speaker to play a beat corresponding to
the switches on the DE2 board.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
Get all speakers to play at the same time. Get the DE2 board to switch between which speaker
is receiving input.

What is your backup plan if things don’t work out as planned?
If we can’t get multiple speakers working in lab 3, we will at least have one speaker that loops
through a pattern. In which case we will try to change it into multiple notes instead of just one on
one speaker.

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board
We will need 4 (or however many Brian will give us) speakers and any wires (or additional
hardware) needed to connect the speakers to the DE2 board.
Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
We will explore the use of Finite State machines to cycle through different speakers and the
note patterns. We will look at using clock cycles to control the sounds being produced and to
cycle through the note patterns.

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
For CSCB58 students, this project is interesting because by using the things we learned in this
course, we are creating music using computer hardware without aid of a music software.
For non CSCB58 students, this project is cool because it’s like a mini mixtable that allows users
to creatively make short tunes.

Why did you personally choose this project?:
We were inspired by the Oskar Fischinger google doodle, which allows user to compose a sort
beat by choosing a pattern of multiple notes.
